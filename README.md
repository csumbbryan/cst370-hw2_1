# CST370-HW2_1_Java

Write a Java program for hw2_1 that reads input numbers from a user and displays the closest distance between two numbers among all input numbers.

Input format: This is a sample input from a user.

5
7
-7
20
8
15


The first number (= 5 in the example) indicates that there will be five integer numbers in the input. Then, all numbers from the second line (= 7 in the example) to the last line (15 in the example) are actual numbers. Thus, your program should read them and present the closest distance among five numbers 7, -7, 20, 8, and 15. Because the distance between 7 and 8 is 1, your answer should be 1. Note that the distance between two numbers should be always positive. For the problem, you can assume that all input numbers are distinct (= no duplication).


Sample Run 0: Assume that the user typed the following six lines

5
7
-7
20
8
15

This is the correct output of your program.

Min Distance:1
Pair:7 8

Note that the sequence of two numbers for the pair is important. Your program has to display the small number first. So, the correct answer for the pair is 7 and then 8. If your program displays 8 and then 7, it’s not correct. If there is more than one pair for the minimum distance, all pairs must be displayed in ascending order. 


Sample Run 1: Assume that the user typed the following lines

10
-1
10
-15
3
72
14
12
-20
5
30


This is the correct output of your program.

Min Distance:2
Pair:3 5
Pair:10 12
Pair:12 14

For the program, you can assume that the number of input values is less than 500.


Sample Run 2: Assume that the user typed the following lines

7
1234
45678
-9090
8901
0
-12345
5678


This is the correct output of your program.

Min Distance:1234
Pair:0 1234
